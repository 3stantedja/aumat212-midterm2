    \begin{problem}
        Verify the limit does not exist:
        \(\displaystyle \lim_{\substack{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0) \\ x \neq \pm y}} \ln \left|\frac{x^2 + y^2}{x^2 - y^2} \right|\).

        [\textit{Note:} An \(\varepsilon\)-\(\delta\) argument is \emph{not} required.]
    \end{problem}
    \begin{answer}
        The limit does not exist because in the case that we set \(x = 0\) we can see that at \(y = 0\) the result for \(\ln \left|\frac{x^2 + y^2}{x^2 - y^2} \right|\) is undefined, and same goes for the case where we set \(y = 0\). No matter how we manipulate the formula the result would still be undefined, and 0 is neither positive nor negative. As such we say that the limit does not exist.
    \end{answer}
